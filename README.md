#My Own Portfolio

This particular project is catered towards making a website to display my skillsets, achievements and to allow the viewer to know more about me. Generally, it is more directed towards employers and scouters who are looking for suitable employees to join their company/organisation. It will go in depth about a few major achievements that I have accomplished over the my years in Secondary School and my general core and technical skills that is helpful/suitable to the company.

#Design Process

As mentioned before, the website is more catered to employers and scouters who wants to find people suitable for their company. I believe that the website can display my skills and accomplishments and be able to allow them to make a judgement as to wheather I am the person that they need for their company. 

Initially, I wanted a website that was straightfoward and clear cut so as to allow the viewer to quickly make a judgement without scrolling or looking around the website for too long. However, this felt rushed and the content provided was not too sufficient so I had to alter the format to make it more organised and concise. Similarly to the mobile version, the main problem is to design it in a way that allows the viewer to instantly grasp the point of the content.

The coloring was decided to be Black, Grey with a Red contrast. I felt that this would make it easier for the viewer to see the contents without it being too bright while still hightlighting key points of the contents and using coloring to clearly identify the structure of a layout.

#Features

- Feature 1: Navigation Bar


Commonly, this is the norm for a lot of websites. I used a overarching navigation bar on the top of the website that exists in all pages in order to allow the viewer to have an easy access to any of the pages they want to view. This is important as the viewer would not have to go through the hassle of entering and exiting multiple pages in order to just view a singluar page of content.

- Feature 2: Mobile Navigation


One of the problem I faced while creating the website is that the orginal navigation bar was not able to fit into the space of the mobile resolution. Thus, some changes have to be made. Changing the font size won't work because it is too small so the only option I thought of is to use a bullet point that the user can select on the top right of the screen. It then drops down a menu showing the contents of the navigation bar which just fits the resolution and works the same to the desktop view. This allows the user to be able to navigate around on mobile view while not being hindered.


- Feature 3: Sectioning


The third feature is sectioning. Looking at the other websites for inspirations, I found out that most of them clutter their content on a singlur page and I am not a fan of this because it takes quite a lot of time for the viewer to process the information. Moreover, if the organisation isn't good, it is difficult to decipher the information. As such, instead of only creating a few HTML pages, I have created sub-sections such as HTML pages for the project HTML page in order to better organise my content. For example, if a user wants to view my projects, they can choose from the projects available instead of having all shown to them at once. This allows the UI to be more user-friendly.


# Technology Used

- HTML : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

HTML is the bread and butter of web programming so it is definitely used here.

- CSS : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

CSS works hand in hand with HTML to make the design more user-friendly and digestable so as to not confuse or overwhelm the user.

- Javascript : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

Javascript is mainly used here for interactive purposes on the website. For instance, I used javascript to make the bullet point on the navigation bar for the mobile view.

- Adobe XD : https://www.adobe.com/sg/products/xd.html

The main wire framing for the website design is created in Adobe XD. It has helped greatly in visualising my design for the website.
