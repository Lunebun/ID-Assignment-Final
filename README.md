#My Own Portfolio

This particular project is catered towards making a website to display my skillsets, achievements and to allow the viewer to know more about me. Generally, it is more directed towards employers and scouters who are looking for suitable employees to join their company/organisation. It will go in depth about a few major achievements that I have accomplished over the my years in Secondary School and my general core and technical skills that is helpful/suitable to the company.

#Design Process

As mentioned before, the website is more catered to employers and scouters who wants to find people suitable for their company. I believe that the website can display my skills and accomplishments and be able to allow them to make a judgement as to wheather I am the person that they need for their company. 

Initially, I wanted a website that was straightfoward and clear cut so as to allow the viewer to quickly make a judgement without scrolling or looking around the website for too long. However, this felt rushed and the content provided was not too succifcient so I had to alter the format to make it more organised and concise.
