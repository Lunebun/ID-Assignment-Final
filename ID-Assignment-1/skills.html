                    <h2>1. Leadership (Core)</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of my most confident skills that I think I have is leadership. I was once the section leader of my club in Secondary School
                        so being exposed to a leading position is nothing new to me. I actively take part in activities and always care about the well being of my section.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Coding (Technical)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Coding is one my technical skills that I am confident in. I have undergone the course of Python, the image shown is the code of a game that I created, and I am currently learning programming in the languages of C#, HTML and Javascript.
