                    <p>
                        In the first semester this year, I had the opportunity to design a product that would be beneficial to the community. The product that our group came up with is a walking stick made specifically for the blind to cross gaps
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was a walking stick with a mechanism that allows the user to deploy and retract the extensions that allow them to cross gaps.
